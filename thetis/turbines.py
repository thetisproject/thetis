class TurbineFarm(object):
    """
    Evaluates power output, costs and profit of tidal turbine farm

    Cost is simply the number of turbines evaluated as the integral of the
    turbine density.

    Power output is calculated as the amount of energy
    taken out of the flow by the turbine drag term. This is in general
    an over-estimate of the 'usefully extractable' energy. Furthermore no
    density is included, so that assuming a density of 1000 kg/m^3 and
    all further quantities in SI, the power is measured in kW.

    Profit is calculated as:

      Profit = Power - break_even_wattage * Cost

    With the above assumptions, break_even_wattage should be specified in
    kW and can be interpreted as the average power per turbine required
    to 'break even', i.e. Profit=0.

    Power output and profit are time-integrated (simple first order) and
    time-averages are available as average_power and average_profit.
