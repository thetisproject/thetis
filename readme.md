# ðŸŒŠ Thetis

[![Build Status](https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis/actions/workflows/build.yml)
![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue)

**Thetis** is an open-source, finite element framework for simulating **coastal and estuarine flows** with advanced numerics, high flexibility, and easy extensibility.

Thetis builds on the [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) finite element library to provide robust solvers for 2D/3D shallow water equations and related physical processes in the coastal ocean.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Thetis relies on Firedrake â€” please follow the [Firedrake installation instructions](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html) first.

Then, to install Thetis:

```bash
# Non-editable latest install - see website for editable install!
pip install git+https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis.git
```

## Getting Started

To get up and running with Thetis once it has been installed, we recommend checking out the [basic tutorials and 
documentation](https://thetisproject.org/documentation.html#tutorials). Further examples can then be found in the 
repository at [`examples`](./examples). See [`examples/README.md`](./examples/readme.md) for 
detailed descriptions of each example script.
