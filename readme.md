# ðŸŒŠ Thetis

[![Weekly Tests (master)](https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis/actions/workflows/weekly-master.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis/actions/workflows/weekly-master.yml)
![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue)

**Thetis** is an open-source, finite element framework for simulating **coastal and estuarine flows** with advanced numerics, high flexibility, and easy extensibility.

Thetis builds on the [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) finite element library to provide robust solvers for 2D/3D shallow water equations and related physical processes in the coastal ocean.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

âœ… 2D depth-averaged and 3D baroclinic shallow water solvers  
âœ… Wetting and drying schemes for realistic coastlines  
âœ… Scalar transport (salinity, temperature, tracers)  
âœ… Adjoint capabilities for data assimilation and inverse modeling  
âœ… Flexible unstructured meshes  
âœ… Open-source and easily extensible Python codebase

## ðŸš€ Installation


Please see the [installation instructions on the website](https://thetisproject.org/installation.html) for full details.

For the release branch:

1. Install **[Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html)** and activate its virtual environment.  
2. Install Thetis within the Firedrake environment:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis.git
```
You can instead install and switch between different versions of Thetis with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis
cd thetis
git checkout <branch_name>
pip install -e .
```
> **Note**
> The latest development branch of Thetis (master) will require the corresponding main branch of Firedrake. See the
> website for more details.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with Thetis once it has been installed, we recommend checking out the [basic tutorials and 
documentation](https://thetisproject.org/documentation.html#tutorials). Further examples can then be found in the 
repository at [`examples`](./examples). See [`examples/README.md`](./examples/readme.md) for 
detailed descriptions of each example script.
