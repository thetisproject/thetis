2D sediment transport formulation
=================================

.. highlight:: python

Governing equations
-------------------

Suspended sediment transport is modelled in two dimensions
using an advection-diffusion equation
:eq:`sediment_eq_2d`.
If solved in non-conservative form, the prognostic variable
is the passive tracer concentration,
:math:`T`. The corresponding field in Thetis is called
``'sediment_2d'``.

A conservative suspended sediment transport model is also
available. In this case, the equation is solved for
:math:`q=HT`, where
:math:`H` is the total water depth.
The conservative tracer model is specified using the
:ref:`ModelOptions2d<model_options_2d>`.\ :py:attr:`.use_sediment_conservative_form`
option.

Bedload transport is modelled in two dimensions using the
Exner equation
:eq:`exner_eq`.
It is solved for the bedlevel,
:math:`z_b`, which has the effect of modifying the bathymetry.
The corresponding field in Thetis is called
``'bathymetry_2d'``.

To activate the 2D sediment model, set the
:ref:`ModelOptions2d<model_options_2d>`.\ :py:attr:`.solve_suspended_sediment`
and
:ref:`ModelOptions2d<model_options_2d>`.\ :py:attr:`.solve_exner`
options to
``True``.

Spatial discretization
----------------------

Thetis currently only supports suspended sediment in P1DG space.
The function space used for the bedlevel is determined by that
used for the bathymetry. Typically, this is P1.

Temporal discretization
-----------------------

Thetis supports different time integration methods, set by the
:ref:`ModelOptions2d<model_options_2d>`.\ :py:attr:`.timestepper_type` option.
Note that the same time integration method will be used for both the shallow
water equations and the 2D sediment model.
