The Thetis project
==================

Thetis is an unstructured grid coastal ocean model built using the
`Firedrake <http://www.firedrakeproject.org/>`__ finite element framework.
Currently Thetis consists of 2D depth averaged and full 3D baroclinic models.

Some example animations are shown below. More animations can be found in the
`Youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0FYtpH1unCy_qcoI46CnRA>`__.
