# Demos

This folder contains basic **demonstration tutorials** for Thetis.  
They are a good place to get started if youâ€™re new to Thetis â€” the demos introduce core concepts step-by-step.

These tutorials are written in **reStructuredText (reST)** and built with **Sphinx** so they can be followed online at 
[thetisproject.org/documentation.html](https://thetisproject.org/documentation.html), which might be the best place to 
start as each example has additional explanations and figures where necessary. There are also a couple of Jupyter 
Notebooks which can be run locally or on Colab (see online documentation).

Each tutorial is also available here, so you can run or modify them locally if you prefer.
