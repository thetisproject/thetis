Tidal farm optimisation example
=======================================

This example is based on the OpenTidalFarm example:
http://opentidalfarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/headland-optimization/headland-optimization.html

It optimises the layout of a tidalfarm using the so called continuous approach where
the density of turbines within a farm (n/o turbines per unit area) is optimised. This
allows a.o to include a cost term based on the number of turbines which is computed as
the integral of the density. For more details, see:
  S.W. Funke, S.C. Kramer, and M.D. Piggott, "Design optimisation and resource assessment
  for tidal-stream renewable energy farms using a new continuous turbine approach",
