# Thetis Examples

This directory contains self-contained example simulations showcasing different Thetis capabilities‚Äîfrom 2D 
shallow-water flows to 3D baroclinic dynamics, sediment transport, tracer cases, and inverse modeling.

Each subfolder includes a Python script (e.g. `channel2d.py`), which you can run directly or in parallel.
